            <p>
                Depending on breed,management and environmenr, the modern domestic hotse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30
              years. uncommonly, a few Animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. the oldest verifiable
              record was "old billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. in modern times, suger
              puff, who had been listed in guinness world records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007
              at age 56.
               regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each january 1 of
              each year in the northern hemisphere. and each august 1 in the southern hemisphere. the exception is in endurance riding, where
              the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar horses of various ages:

                <b>Foal-</b>
                a horse of eather sex less then one year old. a nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling, and a foal
                that has been weaned is called a weanling. most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, 
                although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.

                <b>Yearling-</b>
                a horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.

            <p>
                <b>Colt-</b>
                a male horse under the age of foue. a common terminology error is to call any young horse
                 a "colt", when the term actually onlyrefers to young male horses.

            <p>
                <b>Filly-</b>
                a female horse four years old and older.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Mare-</b>
                a female horse four years old and older.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Stallion-</b>
                a non-castrated male horse four years old and older. the term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially
                to refer specifically to a stallion.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Gelding-</b>
                a castranted male horse of any age.
                in horse racing, these definitions may differ: for example,  in the british isles, thoroughbred 
                horse racing difines colts and fillies as less then five years old. however, australian
                thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less then four years old.

            <h2> Demestication</h2>
            <p>
                Domestication of the horse most likely took plase in central asia prior to 3500BCE. two major sources of information are used to determine where and whrn the horse was first
                domesticated and how the domesticared horse spread on palaeological and source is comparison 
                of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.
                The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000–3500 BCE. By 3000 BCE, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BCE.

A 2021 genetic study suggested that most modern domestic horses descend from the lower Volga-Don region. Ancient horse genomes indicate that these populations influenced almost all local populations as they expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, beginning about 4,200 years ago. It also shows that certain adaptations were strongly selected due to riding, and that equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots spread with the horse itself.

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations.
<p> The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated. herds This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA).</p><p> There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation.In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BCE.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication. Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.

            <h3>breeds</h3>
            <p>   
                The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry. Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition.</p><p> These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines. These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.

                Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work. Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.</p><p> Heavy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. Other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets. Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed. There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.

           <h4>sport</h4> 
            <p>
                Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing, and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. </p><p>Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.

                Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting. Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as "In-hand" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider. Sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.
                
                Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.
