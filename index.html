                <b>Horse</b> (equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated,
                one-toed, hoofed mammal. it belongs to the taxonomic family
                equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus.
                the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million
                years from a small multi-toed creature, eohippus, into 
                the large, single-toed animal of today humans began
                domestication horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication
                is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. horses in the
                subspecies caballus are domesticated,although some
                    domesticated populations
            live in the wild as feral horses. these feral populations are
            not true wild houses, as this term is used to describe horses
            thet tave never been domesticated. there is an extensive,
            specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related 
            concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages,
                size, color, markings, breeds, locomotion, and bahavior.</p>
            <p>
                Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators,
                 and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. 
                 Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses
                  are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to
                   sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their
                    young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand
                     and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under 
                     a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full
                      adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 
                      30 years.
